# GeolocationApp
Python app to show Places details and directions

This project is based on API Firsr aproach.
That means all project was build based on an API Design strategy.
I used the swagger (2.0) framework as part of the development.

## API Design

I split the development in two pieces.

- First the FrontEnd API.
    To this I wrote the code ./places-v1.yml
- Second the BackEnd API.
    For the seconde one I wrote the ./app.py code.
 
## Installation

- Python 3.7.4
- Flask
- Google APIs (Place detail and directions)
  - To get started with Google APis, the first step is getting and configuring the [API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
 - just one more info

## Run

- Install and start MySQL on LocalHost.
- Install Python 3.
-  Run app.py.
